| Compliance & Regulatory Risk          | **Financial Crime Prevention & Oversight**: Focuses on meeting mandatory legal obligations for Anti-Money Laundering (AML), identifying Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), and ensuring accurate regulatory reporting (e.g., GDPR, MiFID II). The core purpose is to prevent financial crime and avoid regulatory fines.                               |
| Credit Risk Management & IRB Approach | **Capital Adequacy & Lending Risk**: Simulates the advanced approach (IRB) for calculating the bank's regulatory capital reserves (Risk Weighted Assets - RWA) based on the likelihood of customer defaults (PD, LGD, EAD). The core purpose is to ensure financial stability and solvency.                                                            |
| Operational Risk Management           | **Day-to-Day Business Resilience**: Covers risks arising from execution failure, system failure, or external events. Focuses on real-time transaction monitoring, managing settlement/counterparty risk, and ensuring robust data governance (e.g., customer audit trails). The core purpose is to maintain service quality and operational stability. |
| Financial Crime Prevention            | **Anomaly Detection & Fraud Control**: A practical layer of defense against money laundering and fraud, using behavioral baselines to detect high-risk patterns like structuring, large-value trades, and suspicious cross-border activity. The core purpose is to protect the bank's assets and reputation.                                           |
| Key Capabilities                      | **Data Utility for GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance)**: The generated data is engineered for specific validation tasks, including testing vendor RegTech systems, calibrating internal risk scoring models, and providing an auditable, end-to-end data lineage for regulatory examiners.                                                             |

## ð Quick Start

### **One-Command Deployment (Recommended)**

Deploy the complete synthetic bank with automatic data upload:

```bash
# 1. Generate comprehensive data (19 months for proper dormancy and churn testing)
./data_generator.sh 1000 --clean

# 2. Deploy everything (structure + data upload + task activation)
./deploy-structure.sh --DATABASE=AAA_DEV_SYNTHETIC_BANK --CONNECTION_NAME=<my-sf-connection>
```

**Result**: Fully operational synthetic bank with all data loaded and processing automatically! ð

**What gets generated:**
- 1000 customers with extended attributes (employment, account tier, risk profile)
- 19 months of payment transactions, equity trades, fixed income & commodity trades
- SWIFT ISO20022 messages, PEP data, mortgage emails
- Customer lifecycle events, status history, address & attribute updates (SCD Type 2)
- FX rates and anomaly patterns for AML testing

**â ï¸ Important**: Always generate data **before** deploying structure, as the deployment script expects the generated files to exist for automatic upload.

### **Step-by-Step Deployment**

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# 1. Generate data (default: 20 customers, 19 months, all generators)
./data_generator.sh

# 2. Deploy SQL structure
./deploy-structure.sh --DATABASE=AAA_DEV_SYNTHETIC_BANK --CONNECTION_NAME=<my-sf-connection>

# 3. Upload data manually (if needed)
./upload-data.sh --CONNECTION_NAME=<my-sf-connection>
```

**â ï¸ Important**: Data generation must happen **before** structure deployment!

### **Testing & Debugging**

```bash
# Preview everything (dry run)
./deploy-structure.sh --DATABASE=AAA_DEV_SYNTHETIC_BANK --CONNECTION_NAME=<my-sf-connection> --DRY_RUN

# Test single SQL file
./deploy-structure.sh --DATABASE=AAA_DEV_SYNTHETIC_BANK --CONNECTION_NAME=<my-sf-connection> --FILE=031_ICGI_swift_messages.sql
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Generate default dataset (20 customers, 19 months, all generators):

```bash
./data_generator.sh
```

### Advanced Usage

#### Generate Everything (Complete Dataset)

**Recommended: Use the one-command data generator script:**

# Generate default dataset (20 customers, 19 months)
./data_generator.sh

# Generate with custom customer count
./data_generator.sh 100

# Generate with cleanup (removes previous data first)
./data_generator.sh 100 --clean
```

**What gets generated:**
- Customer master data with extended attributes (employment, account tier, risk profile)
- Payment transactions & accounts
- Equity, fixed income, and commodity trades
- SWIFT ISO20022 messages & mortgage emails

  - Medium transactions ($1,000-$10,000): 0-2 business days settlement
  - Large transactions (> $10,000): May require 0-3 business days for verification
  - International transactions: Additional 1-2 day delays for non-USD currencies
  - Weekend handling: Value dates skip weekends automatically

### Anomaly Patterns
- **Temporal Clustering**: Anomalies occur in concentrated time periods
- **Amount Escalation**: Gradual increase in suspicious transaction amounts
- **Pattern Mixing**: Multiple anomaly types can occur for the same customer
- **Realistic Timing**: Even anomalous transactions follow some business patterns

- **NumPy**: Provides log-normal distribution for realistic transaction amounts
- **Standard Library**: Uses built-in Python modules for core functionality

### Performance
- Generates approximately 1000 transactions per second
- Memory usage scales linearly with customer count
- Optimized for datasets up to 10,000 customers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### **Data Generation Issues**
```bash
# Error: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'faker'"
# Solution: Ensure virtual environment is set up and dependencies installed
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Error: "Customer file not found"
# Solution: Ensure you run data generation before deployment
./data_generator.sh 100 --clean

# Error: "Invalid arguments: Number of customers must be positive"
# Solution: Use valid customer count
./data_generator.sh 100  # Valid
./data_generator.sh -5   # Invalid (negative numbers not allowed)
```

#### **Snowflake Connection Issues**
```bash
# Error: "Connection not found"
# Solution: Add your connection first
snow connection add <my-sf-connection>

# Error: "Database does not exist"
# Solution: Create database first
snow sql -c <my-sf-connection> -q "CREATE DATABASE AAA_DEV_SYNTHETIC_BANK;"
```

#### **Deployment Issues**
```bash
# Error: "SQL compilation error: Tag 'SENSITIVITY_LEVEL' does not exist"
# Solution: Create the tag first
snow sql -c <my-sf-connection> -q "CREATE TAG SENSITIVITY_LEVEL;"

# Error: "Stream has no data"
# Solution: Check if data was uploaded successfully
./upload-data.sh --CONNECTION_NAME=<my-sf-connection>
```

#### **Performance Issues**
```bash
# For large datasets (1000+ customers):
# 1. Increase Snowflake warehouse size in your connection settings
# 2. The data_generator.sh script is optimized for parallel processing

# Generate large dataset
./data_generator.sh 1000 --clean

# For very large datasets, monitor progress and adjust parameters in data_generator.sh if needed
# See DATA_GENERATOR_USAGE.md for advanced main.py usage with custom parallel workers
```

### **Data Quality Validation**
```sql
-- Check customer data quality
SELECT COUNT(*) as customer_count FROM CRMI_CUSTOMER;
SELECT COUNT(*) as account_count FROM ACCI_ACCOUNT;
SELECT COUNT(*) as transaction_count FROM PAYI_TRANSACTION;

-- Check for data completeness
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_customers,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN has_anomaly = true THEN 1 END) as anomalous_customers,
    ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN has_anomaly = true THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as anomaly_percentage
FROM CRMI_CUSTOMER;
```
