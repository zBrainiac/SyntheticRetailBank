-- LOA_RAW_v001 Schema - Loan & Document Processing (Raw Data Layer)
-- Generated on: 2025-10-04
-- ============================================================
--
-- OVERVIEW:
-- This schema provides the foundational raw data layer for loan applications,
-- mortgage documentation, and related document processing. It handles the ingestion
-- and storage of email communications and PDF documents for downstream processing
-- and business intelligence using DocAI capabilities.
--
-- BUSINESS PURPOSE:
-- - Document ingestion for loan applications and mortgage processing
-- - Email communication tracking and analysis
-- - PDF document storage for contract analysis and compliance
-- - Foundation for downstream loan processing, risk assessment, and analytics
-- - Support for document intelligence and automated content extraction
--
-- SUPPORTED DOCUMENT TYPES:
-- - Email Files: Customer inquiries, loan applications, internal communications
-- - PDF Documents: Loan agreements, mortgage contracts, financial statements
-- - Future extensibility for additional document types and formats
--
-- OBJECTS CREATED:
-- ┌─ STAGES (2):
-- │  ├─ LOAI_RAW_EMAIL_INBOUND     - Email files for DocAI processing
-- │  └─ LOAI_RAW_PDF_INBOUND       - PDF documents for DocAI processing

-- DATA ARCHITECTURE:
-- Email files → LOAI_RAW_EMAIL_INBOUND → Stream Detection → Automated Task → Raw Table → DocAI Processing
-- PDF documents → LOAI_RAW_PDF_INBOUND → Stream Detection → Automated Task → Raw Table → DocAI Processing
--
-- PROCESSING PATTERNS:
-- - Email Files: *.eml, *.msg, *.mbox for DocAI content extraction
-- - PDF Documents: *.pdf for DocAI intelligent document analysis
-- - Metadata capture (filename, load timestamp) for data lineage and audit
-- - Error handling with ON_ERROR = CONTINUE for resilient processing
-- - Stream-based triggering for near real-time processing efficiency
-- - DocAI integration for automated document intelligence and content extraction
