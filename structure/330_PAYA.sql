-- PAY_AGG_001 Schema - Payment Transaction Anomaly Detection & Behavioral Analytics
-- Generated on: 2025-09-28 (Created for abnormal transaction detection)
-- ============================================================
--
-- OVERVIEW:
-- This schema provides advanced payment transaction analytics with behavioral anomaly
-- detection capabilities. It analyzes individual customer payment patterns to identify
-- transactions that deviate significantly from their normal behavior, supporting
-- fraud detection, compliance monitoring, and risk management operations.
--
-- BUSINESS PURPOSE:
-- - Detect abnormal payment transactions based on individual customer behavior patterns
-- - Identify deviations in transaction amounts, frequencies, and timing patterns
-- - Support fraud detection and prevention through behavioral analytics
-- - Enable compliance monitoring for unusual transaction patterns
-- - Provide risk scoring for transactions based on historical customer behavior
-- - Support operational monitoring and customer service investigations
--
-- ANOMALY DETECTION METHODOLOGY:
-- - Statistical analysis of customer transaction history (amounts, frequency, timing)
-- - Deviation scoring based on standard deviations from customer norms
-- - Pattern recognition for unusual transaction characteristics
-- - Multi-dimensional behavioral profiling (amount, frequency, time, counterparty)
-- - Risk scoring with configurable thresholds for operational alerting
-- - Extended time ranges (450/120 days) to work with historical synthetic data (2024)
--
-- OBJECTS CREATED:
-- ┌─ DYNAMIC TABLES (3):
-- │  ├─ PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES - Abnormal transaction detection with scoring
-- │  ├─ PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES - Current account balances per account number
-- │  └─ PAYA_AGG_DT_TIME_WEIGHTED_RETURN - Investment performance with TWR methodology
-- │
-- └─ REFRESH STRATEGY:
--    ├─ TARGET_LAG: 1 hour (aligned with operational monitoring requirements)
--    ├─ WAREHOUSE: MD_TEST_WH
--    └─ AUTO-REFRESH: Based on source table changes from PAY_RAW_001.PAYI_TRANSACTIONS and CRM_AGG_001.ACCA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNTS
--
-- ANOMALY DETECTION CRITERIA:
-- - Amount Anomalies: Transactions significantly above/below customer's typical range
-- - Frequency Anomalies: Unusual transaction frequency patterns (too many/few)
-- - Timing Anomalies: Transactions at unusual times for the customer
-- - Velocity Anomalies: Rapid succession of transactions beyond normal patterns
-- - Counterparty Anomalies: Transactions to new or unusual counterparties
-- - Geographic Anomalies: Transactions from unusual locations (if available)
--
-- SUPPORTED CURRENCIES:
-- - Multi-currency support (EUR, GBP, USD, CHF, NOK, SEK, DKK)
-- - Currency-normalized anomaly detection for cross-border customers
-- - Exchange rate considerations for behavioral pattern analysis
--
-- RELATED SCHEMAS:
-- - PAY_RAW_001: Source payment transaction data
-- - CRM_RAW_001: Customer master data for behavioral profiling
-- - CRM_AGG_001: Account aggregation layer (ACCA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNTS) and customer demographic data
-- - REF_AGG_001: Enhanced FX rates (REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED) for real-time currency conversion with analytics

-- ============================================================
-- NOTE: Time Weighted Return (TWR) Performance Analysis has been moved to REP_AGG_001
-- ============================================================
-- Portfolio performance measurement (combining cash + equity) is now in:
-- REP_AGG_001.REPP_AGG_DT_PORTFOLIO_PERFORMANCE
--
-- This provides integrated performance analytics across all asset classes including:
-- - Cash account performance (from PAYI_TRANSACTIONS)
-- - Equity trading performance (from EQTI_TRADES)
-- - Combined portfolio TWR with asset allocation
-- - Risk-adjusted returns and performance classification
--
-- The reporting layer (REP_AGG_001) is the proper location for cross-domain analytics.
-- ============================================================

-- ============================================================
-- SCHEMA COMPLETION STATUS
-- ============================================================
-- ✅ PAY_AGG_001 Schema Deployment Complete
--
-- OBJECTS CREATED:
-- • 2 Dynamic Tables: 
--   - PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES (behavioral anomaly detection)
--   - PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES (real-time account balance calculation)
-- • Advanced anomaly detection: Multi-dimensional behavioral analysis
-- • Account balance management: Real-time balance tracking with multi-currency support
-- • Risk scoring: Composite anomaly scores with operational thresholds
-- • Financial reporting: Current balances, activity levels, and balance categorization
-- • Automated refresh: 1-hour TARGET_LAG for near real-time financial operations
--
-- PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT:
-- • Moved to REP_AGG_001.REPP_AGG_DT_PORTFOLIO_PERFORMANCE
-- • Integrates cash + equity for complete portfolio analytics
-- • Cross-domain reporting in proper data layer architecture
--
-- NEXT STEPS:
-- 1. ✅ PAY_AGG_001 schema deployed successfully
-- 2. ✅ Date filters adjusted for historical synthetic data (2024)
-- 3. ✅ Account balance calculation dynamic table added
-- 4. ✅ Portfolio performance moved to reporting layer (REP_AGG_001)
-- 5. Verify dynamic table refresh: SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA PAY_AGG_001;
-- 6. Monitor anomaly detection performance and adjust thresholds if needed
-- 7. Monitor account balance accuracy and transaction allocation logic
-- 8. Integrate with fraud detection systems and operational dashboards
-- 9. Set up alerting for CRITICAL_ANOMALY and HIGH_ANOMALY classifications
-- 10. Set up alerting for overdrawn accounts and dormant account detection
--
-- USAGE EXAMPLES:
--
-- ============================================================
-- ANOMALY DETECTION QUERIES
-- ============================================================
-- -- Query transactions with anomalies
-- SELECT TRANSACTION_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, AMOUNT, CURRENCY, DESCRIPTION, ANOMALY_SCORE
-- FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES 
-- WHERE DESCRIPTION LIKE '%[%]%'
-- ORDER BY ANOMALY_SCORE DESC
-- LIMIT 100;
--
-- -- High-risk transactions (anomaly score > 50)
-- SELECT CUSTOMER_ID, COUNT(*) as high_risk_count, SUM(AMOUNT) as total_amount
-- FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES 
-- WHERE ANOMALY_SCORE > 50
-- GROUP BY CUSTOMER_ID
-- ORDER BY high_risk_count DESC;
--
-- ============================================================
-- ACCOUNT BALANCE QUERIES
-- ============================================================
-- -- Current account balances
-- SELECT ACCOUNT_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, ACCOUNT_TYPE, CURRENT_BALANCE_BASE, BASE_CURRENCY
-- FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES
-- WHERE CURRENT_BALANCE_BASE > 0
-- ORDER BY CURRENT_BALANCE_BASE DESC;
--
-- -- Overdrawn accounts
-- SELECT ACCOUNT_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, CURRENT_BALANCE_BASE, LAST_TRANSACTION_DATE
-- FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES
-- WHERE CURRENT_BALANCE_BASE < 0;
--
-- -- Dormant accounts (no activity in 90+ days)
-- SELECT ACCOUNT_ID, CUSTOMER_ID, CURRENT_BALANCE_BASE, LAST_TRANSACTION_DATE, DAYS_SINCE_LAST_TRANSACTION
-- FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES
-- WHERE DAYS_SINCE_LAST_TRANSACTION > 90;
--
-- ============================================================
-- PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE QUERIES (Now in REP_AGG_001)
-- ============================================================
-- -- Integrated portfolio performance (cash + equity)
-- SELECT ACCOUNT_ID, CUSTOMER_ID,

--        PERFORMANCE_CATEGORY
-- FROM REP_AGG_001.REPP_AGG_DT_PORTFOLIO_PERFORMANCE
-- ORDER BY TOTAL_PORTFOLIO_TWR_PERCENTAGE DESC;

-- FROM REP_AGG_001.REPP_AGG_DT_PORTFOLIO_PERFORMANCE
-- WHERE PERFORMANCE_CATEGORY IN ('EXCELLENT_PERFORMANCE', 'GOOD_PERFORMANCE')
-- ORDER BY TOTAL_PORTFOLIO_TWR_PERCENTAGE DESC
-- LIMIT 20;
--
-- -- Portfolio allocation analysis
-- SELECT 
--     PORTFOLIO_TYPE,
--     COUNT(*) as account_count,
--     AVG(TOTAL_PORTFOLIO_TWR_PERCENTAGE) as avg_return,

--     AVG(EQUITY_ALLOCATION_PERCENTAGE) as avg_equity_allocation
-- FROM REP_AGG_001.REPP_AGG_DT_PORTFOLIO_PERFORMANCE
-- GROUP BY PORTFOLIO_TYPE;
--
-- To check dynamic table refresh status:
-- SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA AAA_DEV_SYNTHETIC_BANK.PAY_AGG_001;
--
-- To manually refresh a dynamic table:
-- ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES REFRESH;
-- ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES REFRESH;
--
-- ============================================================
-- PAY_AGG_001 Schema setup completed!
