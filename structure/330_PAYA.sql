-- PAY_AGG_001 Schema - Payment Transaction Anomaly Detection & Behavioral Analytics
-- Generated on: 2025-09-28 (Created for abnormal transaction detection)
-- ============================================================
--
-- OVERVIEW:
-- This schema provides advanced payment transaction analytics with behavioral anomaly
-- detection capabilities. It analyzes individual customer payment patterns to identify
-- transactions that deviate significantly from their normal behavior, supporting
-- fraud detection, compliance monitoring, and risk management operations.
--
-- BUSINESS PURPOSE:
-- - Detect abnormal payment transactions based on individual customer behavior patterns
-- - Identify deviations in transaction amounts, frequencies, and timing patterns
-- - Support fraud detection and prevention through behavioral analytics
-- - Enable compliance monitoring for unusual transaction patterns
-- - Provide risk scoring for transactions based on historical customer behavior
-- - Support operational monitoring and customer service investigations
--
-- ANOMALY DETECTION METHODOLOGY:
-- - Statistical analysis of customer transaction history (amounts, frequency, timing)
-- - Deviation scoring based on standard deviations from customer norms
-- - Pattern recognition for unusual transaction characteristics
-- - Multi-dimensional behavioral profiling (amount, frequency, time, counterparty)
-- - Risk scoring with configurable thresholds for operational alerting
-- - Extended time ranges (450/120 days) to work with historical synthetic data (2024)
--
-- OBJECTS CREATED:
-- ┌─ DYNAMIC TABLES (2):
-- │  ├─ PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES - Abnormal transaction detection with scoring
-- │  └─ PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES - Current account balances per account number
-- │
-- └─ REFRESH STRATEGY:
--    ├─ TARGET_LAG: 1 hour (aligned with operational monitoring requirements)
--    ├─ WAREHOUSE: MD_TEST_WH
--    └─ AUTO-REFRESH: Based on source table changes from PAY_RAW_001.PAYI_TRANSACTIONS and CRM_AGG_001.ACCA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNTS
--
-- ANOMALY DETECTION CRITERIA:
-- - Amount Anomalies: Transactions significantly above/below customer's typical range
-- - Frequency Anomalies: Unusual transaction frequency patterns (too many/few)
-- - Timing Anomalies: Transactions at unusual times for the customer
-- - Velocity Anomalies: Rapid succession of transactions beyond normal patterns
-- - Counterparty Anomalies: Transactions to new or unusual counterparties
-- - Geographic Anomalies: Transactions from unusual locations (if available)
--
-- SUPPORTED CURRENCIES:
-- - Multi-currency support (EUR, GBP, USD, CHF, NOK, SEK, DKK)
-- - Currency-normalized anomaly detection for cross-border customers
-- - Exchange rate considerations for behavioral pattern analysis
--
-- RELATED SCHEMAS:
-- - PAY_RAW_001: Source payment transaction data
-- - CRM_RAW_001: Customer master data for behavioral profiling
-- - CRM_AGG_001: Account aggregation layer (ACCA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNTS) and customer demographic data
-- - REF_AGG_001: Enhanced FX rates (REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED) for real-time currency conversion with analytics

-- MANUAL REFRESH COMMANDS:
-- ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES REFRESH;
-- ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES REFRESH;
-- ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE PAYA_AGG_DT_TIME_WEIGHTED_RETURN REFRESH;
--
-- DATA REQUIREMENTS:
-- TRANSACTION ANOMALY DETECTION:
-- - Source table PAY_RAW_001.PAYI_TRANSACTIONS must contain transaction data
-- - Minimum 5 transactions per customer for behavioral profiling
-- - Extended time ranges (450/120 days) accommodate historical synthetic data from 2024
-- - CSV files must be uploaded to stage and loaded: FILES named pay_transactions_*.csv (not PAYI_TRANSACTIONS_*.csv)
--
-- ACCOUNT BALANCE CALCULATION:
-- - Source tables: PAY_RAW_001.PAYI_TRANSACTIONS, CRM_AGG_001.ACCA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNTS, and REF_AGG_001.REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED
-- - Account master data must be loaded from raw layer (CRM_RAW_001.ACCI_ACCOUNTS) to aggregation layer
-- - FX rates must be loaded from REF_AGG_001.REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED for accurate currency conversion with analytics
-- - Follows proper data architecture: Raw → Aggregation → Analytics
-- - Transaction-to-account allocation based on transaction characteristics and account types
-- - Dynamic base currency detection with real-time FX rate lookups for multi-currency conversion
--
-- DEBUGGING QUERIES:

-- MONITORING:
-- TRANSACTION ANOMALY DETECTION:
-- - Dynamic table refresh status: SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY()) WHERE NAME = 'PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES';
-- - Anomaly detection performance: SELECT overall_anomaly_classification, COUNT(*) FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES GROUP BY overall_anomaly_classification;
-- - Account coverage: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ACCOUNT_ID) FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_TRANSACTION_ANOMALIES;
--
-- ACCOUNT BALANCE MONITORING:
-- - Balance table refresh status: SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY()) WHERE NAME = 'PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES';
-- - Account balance distribution: SELECT BALANCE_CATEGORY, COUNT(*) FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES GROUP BY BALANCE_CATEGORY;
-- - Account activity summary: SELECT ACTIVITY_LEVEL, COUNT(*) FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES GROUP BY ACTIVITY_LEVEL;
-- - Overdrawn accounts: SELECT COUNT(*) as overdrawn_count, SUM(CURRENT_BALANCE_BASE) as total_overdraft FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_ACCOUNT_BALANCES WHERE IS_OVERDRAWN = TRUE;
--
-- TIME WEIGHTED RETURN MONITORING:
-- - TWR table refresh status: SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY()) WHERE NAME = 'PAYA_AGG_DT_TIME_WEIGHTED_RETURN';
-- - Performance distribution: SELECT PERFORMANCE_CATEGORY, COUNT(*) FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_TIME_WEIGHTED_RETURN GROUP BY PERFORMANCE_CATEGORY;

-- - Average portfolio returns: SELECT AVG(TWR_RETURN_PERCENTAGE) as avg_twr, AVG(ANNUALIZED_TWR_PERCENTAGE) as avg_annualized FROM PAYA_AGG_DT_TIME_WEIGHTED_RETURN;
--
-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
-- - Monitor warehouse usage during refresh periods
-- - Consider clustering on CUSTOMER_ID and BOOKING_DATE for time-based queries
-- - Adjust anomaly detection thresholds based on operational feedback
-- - Archive historical anomaly data based on regulatory retention requirements
