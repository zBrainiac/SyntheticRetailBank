-- REP_AGG_001 Schema - Core Reporting & Analytics
-- Updated on: 2025-10-05 (Split into multiple files for maintainability)
-- ============================================================
--
-- OVERVIEW:
-- This schema contains core dynamic tables for reporting and analytics.
-- Provides customer summaries, transaction analytics, currency exposure,
-- settlement analysis, and anomaly detection for compliance monitoring.
--
-- RELATED FILES:
-- - 510_REPP_EQUITY.sql: Equity trading reporting
-- - 520_REPP_CREDIT_RISK.sql: Credit risk & IRB reporting
-- - 530_REPP_PORTFOLIO.sql: Portfolio performance reporting
--
-- DATA LAYER ARCHITECTURE:
-- - Uses CRM_AGG_001 aggregation layer (not raw CRM_RAW_001)
-- - Uses PAY_AGG_001 aggregation layer (not raw PAY_RAW_001)
-- - Leverages pre-computed customer, account, and payment aggregations
-- - Proper data architecture: RAW → AGG → REPORTING
--
-- OBJECTS CREATED:
