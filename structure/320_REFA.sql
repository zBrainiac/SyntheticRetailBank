-- REF_AGG_001 Schema - Reference Data Aggregation Layer
-- Generated on: 2025-09-29 (FX Rates Aggregation)
-- ============================================================
--
-- OVERVIEW:
-- This schema provides the aggregation layer for reference data, creating
-- enhanced dynamic tables on top of raw reference data from REF_RAW_001.
-- Focuses on foreign exchange rates with business logic and analytics.
--
-- BUSINESS PURPOSE:
-- - Provide enhanced FX rate data with analytics and trends
-- - Enable currency exposure analysis and risk management
-- - Support real-time FX rate lookups for multi-currency operations
-- - Maintain historical FX rate performance and volatility metrics
--
-- AGGREGATION STRATEGY:
-- - Enhanced FX rates with calculated spreads and volatility
-- - Current rates lookup optimized for real-time operations
-- - Historical trend analysis for risk management
-- - Currency pair analytics and market insights
--
-- OBJECTS CREATED:
-- ┌─ DYNAMIC TABLES (1):
-- │  └─ REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED - Enhanced FX rates with analytics
-- │
-- └─ REFRESH STRATEGY:
--    ├─ TARGET_LAG: 1 hour (aligned with operational requirements)
--    ├─ WAREHOUSE: MD_TEST_WH
--    └─ AUTO-REFRESH: Based on source table changes from REF_RAW_001.REFI_FX_RATES
--
-- DATA ARCHITECTURE:
-- Raw FX Rates (REF_RAW_001.REFI_FX_RATES) → Aggregation (REF_AGG_001.REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED) → Analytics
--
-- SUPPORTED CURRENCIES:
-- - CHF (Swiss Franc) - Bank's base currency
-- - EUR (Euro), USD (US Dollar), GBP (British Pound)
-- - Additional currencies as per business requirements
--
-- RELATED SCHEMAS:
-- - REF_RAW_001: Source FX rates data (REFI_FX_RATES)
-- - PAY_AGG_001: Payment analytics using FX rates for currency conversion
-- - CRM_AGG_001: Customer analytics with multi-currency support

-- SCHEMA COMPLETION STATUS
-- ============================================================
-- ✅ REF_AGG_001 FX Rates Aggregation Layer Complete
--
-- OBJECTS CREATED:
-- • 1 Dynamic Table: REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED (comprehensive FX analytics)
-- • Enhanced analytics: Spreads, volatility, trends, risk classifications
-- • Real-time metrics: Current rates, moving averages, position analysis
-- • Automated refresh: 1-hour TARGET_LAG for timely FX data
--
-- NEXT STEPS:
-- 1. ✅ REF_AGG_001 FX rates aggregation layer deployed successfully
-- 2. Verify dynamic table refresh: SHOW DYNAMIC TABLES IN SCHEMA REF_AGG_001;
-- 3. Update downstream consumers to use REF_AGG_001.REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED
-- 4. Test FX analytics: SELECT * FROM REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED WHERE IS_CURRENT_RATE = TRUE;
-- 5. Validate volatility and trend calculations
-- 6. Monitor refresh performance and data quality
--
-- USAGE EXAMPLES:
--
-- -- Get current FX rates for all currency pairs
-- SELECT CURRENCY_PAIR, MID_RATE, SPREAD_PERCENTAGE, TREND_DIRECTION,
--        VOLATILITY_RISK_LEVEL, RATE_POSITION_PERCENTAGE
-- FROM REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED 
-- WHERE IS_CURRENT_RATE = TRUE
-- ORDER BY PAIR_CLASSIFICATION, CURRENCY_PAIR;
--
-- -- Analyze CHF-based currency pairs (bank's base currency)
-- SELECT CURRENCY_PAIR, DATE, MID_RATE, DAILY_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE,
--        MOVING_AVG_7D, VOLATILITY_30D
-- FROM REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED 
-- WHERE CURRENCY_PAIR_TYPE = 'CHF_BASE'
--   AND DATE >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
-- ORDER BY DATE DESC, CURRENCY_PAIR;
--
-- -- High volatility currency pairs for risk management
-- SELECT CURRENCY_PAIR, AVG(VOLATILITY_30D) as avg_volatility,
--        MAX(SPREAD_PERCENTAGE) as max_spread,
--        COUNT(*) as rate_observations
-- FROM REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED 
-- WHERE VOLATILITY_RISK_LEVEL = 'HIGH_VOLATILITY'
--   AND DATE >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
-- GROUP BY CURRENCY_PAIR
-- ORDER BY avg_volatility DESC;
--
-- -- Currency pair performance over time
-- SELECT DATE, CURRENCY_PAIR, MID_RATE, DAILY_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE,
--        RATE_POSITION_PERCENTAGE, TREND_DIRECTION
-- FROM REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED 
-- WHERE CURRENCY_PAIR IN ('CHF/USD', 'CHF/EUR', 'CHF/GBP')
--   AND DATE >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
-- ORDER BY CURRENCY_PAIR, DATE DESC;
--
-- -- Best and worst performing currencies vs CHF
-- SELECT FROM_CURRENCY, TO_CURRENCY,
--        AVG(DAILY_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE) as avg_daily_change,
--        STDDEV(DAILY_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE) as change_volatility,
--        COUNT(*) as observations
-- FROM REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED 
-- WHERE (FROM_CURRENCY = 'CHF' OR TO_CURRENCY = 'CHF')
--   AND DAILY_CHANGE_PERCENTAGE IS NOT NULL
--   AND DATE >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
-- GROUP BY FROM_CURRENCY, TO_CURRENCY
-- ORDER BY avg_daily_change DESC;
--
-- MANUAL REFRESH COMMAND:
-- ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED REFRESH;
--
-- DATA REQUIREMENTS:
-- - Source table REF_RAW_001.REFI_FX_RATES must contain FX rate data
-- - FX rate CSV files must be uploaded to stage and loaded
-- - Raw layer must be populated before aggregation layer can function
--
-- MONITORING:
-- - Dynamic table refresh status: SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLE_REFRESH_HISTORY()) WHERE NAME = 'REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED';
-- - FX data coverage: SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rates, COUNT(DISTINCT CURRENCY_PAIR) as unique_pairs FROM REFA_AGG_DT_FX_RATES_ENHANCED;
-- - Data consistency check: Compare counts with raw layer SELECT COUNT(*) FROM REF_RAW_001.REFI_FX_RATES;
--
-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION:
-- - Monitor warehouse usage during refresh periods
-- - Consider clustering on CURRENCY_PAIR and DATE for query optimization
-- - Archive old FX rates based on business retention requirements
