## The Business Problem We Solved

### Before: The Broken Process

Imagine starting your Monday morning as the **Chief Compliance Officer**. The board meeting is in 2 hours, and you need to answer three questions:

1. **"How many customers are flagged for PEP or sanctions screening?"**
2. **"Can you prove we properly screened customer XYZ?"**
3. **"What's our overall compliance risk exposure?"**

**Traditional Process:**
- Email IT team requesting data exports (Monday 8:00 AM)
- Wait for IT to pull data from 7 different systems (Monday-Tuesday)
- Receive 5 Excel files with inconsistent data (Tuesday afternoon)
- Spend 4 hours reconciling differences (Tuesday evening)
- Manually compile PowerPoint slides (Wednesday morning)
- **Board meeting missed** – Report delivered 2 days late

**Cost:** €1k+ in labor, missed board deadline, CEO frustrated, no time for actual compliance work


### After establishing a centralized digital core

Same Monday morning, same three questions:

**New Process:**
- Open laptop, run three pre-built queries (Monday 8:30 AM)
- Copy results into PowerPoint template (Monday 8:35 AM)
- Review answers, add commentary (Monday 8:45 AM)
- **Board-ready report delivered** – 15 minutes total

**Value:** Zero IT dependency, instant and reliable answers, attend board meeting prepared, CEO impressed

## Detailed Explanations

### Report 1: CRMA_AGG_DT_CUSTOMER_CURRENT
**Business Question:** _"What does this customer look like RIGHT NOW?"_

#### Why It Exists
You're a relationship manager calling a PLATINUM customer. You need to know:
- Do they still work at the same company? (Employment changes affect credit risk)
- Are they still PLATINUM tier or did they downgrade? (Service level expectations)
- What's their preferred contact method? (Email, phone, app?)

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Employment Info:** Where they work, job title, employment type, income bracket
  - *Why it matters:* Job loss = credit risk increase = adjust lending limits
- **Account Status:** STANDARD, SILVER, GOLD, PLATINUM, PREMIUM tier
  - *Why it matters:* Determines service level (free trades vs. relationship manager)
- **Contact Preferences:** Email, phone, preferred method
  - *Why it matters:* Contact them how THEY want, not how it's convenient for us
- **Risk Indicators:** Risk classification, credit score band, anomaly flag
  - *Why it matters:* Know if compliance review needed BEFORE offering credit

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Customer calls asking about mortgage pre-approval

**What you need to know in 30 seconds:**
- Current employment: FULL_TIME at stable company 
- Income range: €100K-150K 
- Credit score: EXCELLENT

- **Risk Mitigation:** Proactive adjustment of lending limits, preventing 1 potential default (€85K exposure)

**Use Case 3: Contact Preference Compliance**
- **Who:** Customer service operations manager
- **Need:** Ensure all PLATINUM customers have preferred contact method = EMAIL or MOBILE_APP (digital-first strategy)
- **Result:** 2 customers prefer POST (mail), relationship manager outreach to migrate to digital channels
- **Cost Savings:** €120/year per customer in mailing costs

### Report 2: CRMA_AGG_DT_CUSTOMER_HISTORY
**Business Question:** _"What changed in this customer's profile, and when?"_

#### Why It Exists
**Compliance requirement:** Regulators ask, _"Prove you knew this customer's employment status on June 15, 2024."_

**Without this table:** Search email archives, call HR, check old reports, cross fingers  
**With this table:** Instant proof, timestamped, complete audit trail

#### What's Inside (Business View)
**Same information as CRMA_AGG_DT_CUSTOMER_CURRENT, but with:**
- **VALID_FROM date:** When this version became true
- **VALID_TO date:** When it was replaced (or NULL if still current)
- **IS_CURRENT flag:** Easy way to see "this is the latest version"

**Example Timeline for Customer CUST_00042:**

| Date | Account Tier | Employment | Risk Class | Why It Changed |

---

### Report 3: CRMA_AGG_DT_ADDRESSES_CURRENT
**Business Question:** _"Where does this customer live RIGHT NOW?"_

#### Why It Exists
You need to:
- Mail annual statements (regulatory requirement)
- Run geo-targeted marketing ("Swiss residents: new mortgage rates!")
- Screen for sanctions (customer moved to embargoed country?)

**Without this table:** Customers have 3 addresses in system (old apartment, parents' house, current home) – which one is right?  
**With this table:** One current address, guaranteed accurate

#### What's Inside (Business View)

---

### Report 4: CRMA_AGG_DT_ADDRESSES_HISTORY
**Business Question:** _"Why did this customer move 5 times in 6 months?"_

#### Why It Exists
**AML red flag:** Frequent address changes = potential money laundering indicator

**Example:** Customer opened account in January (London address), then:
- March: Moved to Paris
- April: Moved to Brussels  
- May: Moved to Amsterdam
- July: Moved to Zurich
- August: Moved to Frankfurt

**Question:** Is this a legitimate international executive, or money launderer avoiding detection?

#### What's Inside (Business View)
**Complete address history with:**
- All previous addresses
- VALID_FROM and VALID_TO dates (proves timeline)
- IS_CURRENT flag (which address is active today)

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** AML system flags customer with 6 address changes in 8 months

**Investigation (2 minutes):**
- Review address history timeline
- Cross-reference with employment changes

**Finding:** Customer is management consultant on multi-country project (legitimate)  
**Action:** Clear flag, document rationale, continue monitoring

**Business outcome:** Avoid false positive, maintain customer relationship

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Fraud Pattern Detection**
- **Who:** Fraud investigation team
- **Need:** Identify customers who changed address immediately before large wire transfer (classic fraud pattern)

**Use Case 2: Life Event Marketing Triggers**
- **Who:** Marketing automation team
- **Need:** Identify customers who recently moved (potential need for home services, mortgages, insurance)
- **Result:** 8 customers moved in last 30 days, automated "Welcome to your new home" campaign with mortgage refinancing offers
- **Revenue:** 2 customers applied for mortgages, €180K total loan value, €1.8K origination fees

**Use Case 3: Customer Stability Scoring**
- **Who:** Credit risk team reviewing loan applications
- **Need:** Assess address stability as part of credit risk model (frequent moves = instability indicator)
- **Result:** Applicant has 1 address in 5 years (stable) vs. comparison applicant with 4 addresses in 2 years (unstable)
- **Risk Adjustment:** Loan approved for stable customer, additional collateral required for unstable applicant

---

### Report 5: CRMA_AGG_DT_CUSTOMER_LIFECYCLE
**Business Question:** _"Is this customer about to leave us?"_

#### Why It Exists
**The churn problem:** Customers don't call to say goodbye—they just stop transacting

**Traditional banking:** Notice customer left 6 months after they're gone  
**Modern banking:** Predict churn 45 days in advance, intervene proactively

#### What's Inside (Business View)

**1. Lifecycle Stage** (Where is the customer in their journey?)
- **NEW:** Just onboarded (first 90 days)
- **ACTIVE:** Regular engagement, healthy relationship
- **MATURE:** Long-term customer, stable patterns
- **DECLINING:** Engagement dropping, warning sign
- **DORMANT:** No activity in 180+ days, intervention needed
- **CHURNED:** Relationship ended

**2. Churn Probability** (Will they leave?)
- **0.00-0.30:** Safe, no action needed
- **0.31-0.50:** Monitor, standard engagement
- **0.51-0.70:** At risk, consider outreach
- **0.71-0.85:** High risk, proactive retention campaign
- **0.86-1.00:** Critical, executive intervention required

**3. Engagement Metrics**
- Days since last transaction
- Total lifetime events (logins, transactions, service calls)
- Major life events (address changes, employment changes)

**4. Risk Flags**
- **IS_DORMANT:** Account inactive >180 days (fraud risk + churn risk)
- **IS_AT_RISK:** Declining engagement pattern detected

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Monday morning retention review (Head of Customer Experience)

**Query:** Show me all GOLD/PLATINUM customers with churn probability >70%

**Results:** 8 customers identified

| Customer | Tier | Churn Prob | Last Activity | Issue |
|----------|------|------------|---------------|-------|
| CUST_00042 | PLATINUM | 85% | 67 days ago | Competitor offering better rates |
| CUST_00055 | GOLD | 78% | 45 days ago | Poor customer service experience |
| CUST_00071 | GOLD | 72% | 52 days ago | Job change, financial stress |

**Action Plan:**
- **Week 1:** Relationship manager calls each customer
- **Week 2:** Offer retention incentives (fee waivers, rate discounts)
- **Week 3:** Executive outreach for PLATINUM tier
- **Week 4:** Measure if churn probability decreased

**Business outcome:**
- 6 of 8 customers retained (75% success rate)
- Average customer lifetime value: €24K
- **Revenue saved: €144K**

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 2: Product Cross-Sell Opportunity**
- **Who:** Wealth management team
- **Need:** Find ACTIVE customers with high engagement but only 1 account type (untapped potential)
- **Result:** 22 customers identified, 15 approached with investment account offers, 8 opened new accounts
- **Revenue:** €120K in new AUM (Assets Under Management), €2.4K annual fees

**Use Case 3: Customer Lifecycle Segmentation for Service Model**
- **Who:** COO redesigning service delivery model
- **Need:** Understand customer distribution across lifecycle stages to allocate resources
- **Result:** 15% NEW (high-touch onboarding), 50% ACTIVE (standard service), 20% MATURE (automated), 10% DECLINING (retention focus), 5% DORMANT (reactivation)
- **Strategic Decision:** Shift 2 FTE from MATURE (automated) to DECLINING (retention), projected €300K churn prevention

### Report 6: CRMA_AGG_DT_CUSTOMER_360
**Business Question:** _"Tell me EVERYTHING about this customer in one place"_

#### Why It Exists
**The ultimate problem:** Information scattered across 7 systems, 15 databases, 40 spreadsheets

**Example:** Compliance officer investigating suspicious activity needs:
- Customer's current profile → System 1
- Employment history → System 2  
- Address changes → System 3
- Account types → System 4
- PEP screening results → System 5
- Sanctions check → System 6
- Transaction anomalies → System 7

**Time to gather:** 4 hours  
**Risk:** Miss something, incomplete investigation

#### What's Inside (Business View)

**Combines ALL customer information:**

**1. Core Profile** (from CRMA_AGG_DT_CUSTOMER_CURRENT)
- Name, date of birth, onboarding date
- Employment, income, account tier
- Contact preferences, risk classification

**2. Current Location** (from CRMA_AGG_DT_ADDRESSES_CURRENT)
- Where they live right now
- What country (sanctions screening)

**3. Account Portfolio**
- How many accounts (checking, savings, investment)
- Total relationship value

**4. Compliance Screening Results**

**PEP (Politically Exposed Person) Matching:**
- **EXACT_MATCH:** Full name matches PEP database → **100% certainty, immediate review required**
- **FUZZY_MATCH:** Similar name, 70-95% match → **Human review needed with context**
- **NO_MATCH:** Clean, no PEP concerns → **Auto-approved**

**Example:** Customer name "John Smith" gets 72% match with "Jon Smith" (UK Parliament member)
- **Old system:** Automatic rejection (false positive)
- **New system:** Shows 72% match + geography mismatch (customer in Switzerland, PEP in UK) → Clear as different person

**Sanctions Screening:**
- **EXACT_MATCH:** On sanctions list → **Account frozen immediately, regulator notified**
- **FUZZY_MATCH:** Similar name, 70-95% → **Enhanced due diligence required**
- **NO_MATCH:** Clear

**5. Overall Risk Assessment**

System automatically calculates risk score (0-100) combining:
- PEP match level (0-30 points)
- Sanctions match (automatic +50 points if flagged)
- Transaction anomalies (+20 points if detected)
- Base risk classification (+10-30 points)
- Lifecycle risk (+10 points if dormant/churning)

**Risk Rating:**
- **CRITICAL (90-100):** Immediate action, senior officer review
- **HIGH (70-89):** 4-hour SLA, detailed investigation
- **MEDIUM (50-69):** 24-hour SLA, standard review
- **LOW (20-49):** Automated approval with monitoring
- **NO_RISK (0-19):** Straight-through processing

**6. Action Flags**

System tells you what to do:
- **REQUIRES_EXPOSED_PERSON_REVIEW = TRUE:** PEP match found, compliance review needed
- **REQUIRES_SANCTIONS_REVIEW = TRUE:** Sanctions match found, immediate escalation
- **HIGH_RISK_CUSTOMER = TRUE:** Multiple risk factors, enhanced monitoring

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** New PLATINUM customer application with €2.5M initial deposit (Swiss entrepreneur)

**Traditional process (5 days):**
- Day 1: Application received, enters queue
- Day 2: Compliance officer manually searches PEP databases
- Day 3: Manually checks sanctions lists
- Day 4: False positive on similar name, escalate to senior officer
- Day 5: Senior officer reviews, approves
- **Cost:** €1,200 labor + €15,000 lost revenue (customer could've earned interest for 5 days)

**With CUSTOMER_360 (4 hours):**
- Hour 1: Application auto-screened against 1.2M PEP records + global sanctions
- Hour 2: System flags 72% name similarity with European politician (FUZZY_MATCH)
- Hour 3: Officer reviews with FULL CONTEXT:
  - Match accuracy: 72% (borderline)
  - Geography: Customer in Switzerland, PEP in Belgium (different person likely)
  - Risk score: 45 (MEDIUM, not CRITICAL)
  - Account tier: PLATINUM (high-value, thorough review warranted)
  - Transaction anomaly: No (clean history)
- Hour 4: Officer clears customer with documented rationale
- **Result:** Customer activated same day, €15K revenue preserved, NPS score 9/10

**Business outcome:**
- 94% faster clearance
- €15K revenue preserved per case
- Customer delighted with service speed
- Officer had time to investigate 4 other cases same day

- **Result:** 
  - Sender: GOLD tier, PEP_MATCH_TYPE = NO_MATCH, OVERALL_RISK_RATING = LOW, legitimate business owner
  - Transaction purpose documented: Equipment purchase for manufacturing business
  - Recipient screening: Not in our customer base (screened separately via external system)
- **Compliance Decision:** Transaction cleared for processing after 45-minute review (vs. 24-hour hold), customer satisfied with responsiveness

**Use Case 5: M&A Due Diligence (Strategic)**
- **Who:** CFO evaluating potential acquisition of competitor bank
- **Need:** Assess customer portfolio quality to determine acquisition price
- **Result:**
  - Average account tier distribution: 40% STANDARD, 30% SILVER, 20% GOLD, 10% PLATINUM

---

### Head of Customer Experience: "How Do I Keep Customers Happy?"

**Business Challenge:** Customers leave without warning, revenue lost forever

**What Changed:**

**Old Reality:**
- Customer stops transacting → No visibility
- 6 months pass → Notice in quarterly review
- Reach out → "I closed my account 5 months ago and moved to competitor"
- **Revenue lost:** €24K per customer (average lifetime value)

**New Reality with CUSTOMER_LIFECYCLE:**
- Customer engagement drops → System detects pattern
- Churn probability increases to 78% → Alert sent to relationship manager
- **45 days advance warning** → Proactive outreach before customer decides to leave
- Retention offer → Customer stays, upgrades to PLATINUM
- **Revenue saved:** €24K + €12K upsell = €36K total value

**Monthly Retention Workflow (2 hours):**

**1. Identify At-Risk High-Value Customers**
- CUSTOMER_LIFECYCLE: Find GOLD/PLATINUM with churn probability >70%
- CUSTOMER_360: Get contact preferences (how do they want to be reached?)
- **Result:** 8 customers flagged this month

**2. Relationship Manager Outreach**
- Week 1: Personal call from assigned RM
- Week 2: Offer retention incentives (fee waivers, preferential rates)
- Week 3: Executive outreach for PLATINUM tier
- Week 4: Measure success (did churn probability decrease?)

**3. Measure Results**
- 6 of 8 retained (75% success rate)
- Total revenue saved: €144K per month
- **Annual value:** €1.7M in prevented churn

**Business Value:**
- **Proactive vs. reactive:** Stop churn before it happens
- **Data-driven decisions:** No guessing, predict with 70-85% accuracy
- **Customer satisfaction:** They feel valued when we reach out proactively

---

### Chief Data Officer: "Is the Platform Working?"

**Daily Responsibility:** Ensure data quality, platform reliability, business trust

**Morning Health Check (10 minutes):**

**1. Data Freshness**
- Verify all 6 tables refreshed in last 60 minutes
- **Why it matters:** Business makes decisions on current data, not yesterday's batch

**2. Data Completeness**
- Check CUSTOMER_CURRENT: Any customers missing email or phone?
- **Why it matters:** Can't contact customer = poor service = churn risk

**3. Data Quality**
- Review CUSTOMER_HISTORY: Do all customers have complete timeline?
- **Why it matters:** Compliance requires complete audit trail, gaps = regulatory risk

**Business Value:**
- **Platform uptime:** 99.9% (3 outages in 12 months, <10 min each)
- **Data accuracy:** 99.7% (verified against source systems weekly)
- **User satisfaction:** Self-service reduces IT tickets by 70% (€280K annual savings)
