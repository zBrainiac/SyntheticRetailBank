## The Business Problem We Solved

### Before: Portfolio Reporting as an Administrative Burden

Imagine it's **Monday morning at 9 AM**. Your **PLATINUM client** is calling:

**Client:** "I need my portfolio performance report for my tax advisor by tomorrow. Can you send it?"

**Traditional Process:**
- **Monday 9:00 AM:** Promise to send report by end of day
- **Monday 9:30 AM:** Email operations team requesting data export
- **Monday 11:00 AM:** Receive 5 Excel files (cash, equity, bonds, commodities, FX)
- **Monday 2:00 PM:** Manually reconcile discrepancies in position values
- **Tuesday 10:00 AM:** Still calculating Time Weighted Return in Excel
- **Tuesday 3:00 PM:** Discover formula error, recalculate everything
- **Wednesday 9:00 AM:** Finally deliver report (2 days late)
- **Wednesday 10:00 AM:** Client: "My competitor got theirs in 30 minutes. I'm moving my €2.4M to them."

**Cost:** €500 in labor, lost client worth €18K annual fees, damaged reputation, advisor demoralized

**The Real Problem:** Portfolio data scattered across systems, manual calculations error-prone, reporting reactive instead of proactive, no time for actual advisory work

---

### After: Wealth Management as Strategic Partnership

Same Monday morning, same client request:

**New Process:**
- **9:00 AM:** Client calls requesting performance report
- **9:02 AM:** Open laptop, run portfolio performance query
- **9:03 AM:** See: YTD return 8.4%, Sharpe ratio 1.23, 65% equity/35% fixed income allocation
- **9:04 AM:** Export to PDF template, add 2-paragraph commentary
- **9:05 AM:** Email report to client
- **9:06 AM:** Call client: "Report sent. I noticed you're overweight equities. Given market volatility, may I suggest rebalancing?"
- **9:15 AM:** Schedule meeting to discuss portfolio optimization
- **Next Week:** Client adds €500K to portfolio, refers two friends

**Value:** 5 minutes vs. 2 days, client delighted, additional AUM captured, referrals generated, time freed for advisory work

**The Transformation:** From **administrative burden** to **strategic partnership** to **revenue growth**

## Part 1: Portfolio Performance Excellence

### The Business Challenge

**Wealth Advisor problem:** Managing 45 client portfolios manually. Performance calculations take 2-3 hours per client. Excel formulas breaking. Can't answer "how am I doing?" in real-time. Clients comparing performance with online brokers who show instant results. Losing high-value clients to digital competitors.

---

### Report 1.1: REPP_AGG_DT_PORTFOLIO_PERFORMANCE
**Business Question:** _"What's my portfolio performance RIGHT NOW, and how does it compare?"_

#### Why It Exists
Traditional wealth management relies on quarterly statements calculated in batch overnight. Client calls Tuesday asking "how's my portfolio performing?" – advisor says "let me get back to you tomorrow." Competitor answers instantly on their mobile app. Client moves €1.2M elsewhere.

**This report changes the game:** Real-time Time Weighted Return (TWR) calculation across ALL asset classes (cash, equity, fixed income, commodities), industry-standard methodology, instant client answers.

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Time Weighted Return (TWR):** Industry-standard performance measurement eliminating cash flow distortions
- **Multi-Asset Coverage:** Integrated view of cash + equity + bonds + commodities
- **Period Performance:** Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, YTD, 1-year, inception-to-date
- **Asset Allocation:** Current portfolio composition and drift from target
- **Risk Metrics:** Volatility, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown
- **Trading Activity:** Transaction counts, commission costs, turnover rate

**Key Metrics Explained:**

**Time Weighted Return (TWR):**
- **What:** Measures investment skill independent of cash flow timing
- **Why:** Client deposits €100K on Day 1, withdraws €50K on Day 180 – doesn't distort returns
- **Formula:** Geometric linking of sub-period returns between cash flows
- **Industry Standard:** Required by GIPS (Global Investment Performance Standards)

**Sharpe Ratio:**
- **What:** Risk-adjusted return measure (return per unit of volatility)
- **Why:** Portfolio A returns 10% with 15% volatility; Portfolio B returns 8% with 5% volatility – which is better?
- **Interpretation:** >1.0 = good, >2.0 = excellent, >3.0 = exceptional
- **Formula:** (Portfolio Return - Risk Free Rate) / Portfolio Volatility

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Monday morning client review meeting (Wealth Advisor)

**Client:** "How's my portfolio doing? My golf buddy says he's up 12% this year."

**Old Process:**
1. Promise to send report after meeting
2. Spend 3 hours calculating performance manually
3. Discover equity trades not reconciled
4. Send report 2 days later
5. Client frustrated: "My buddy knew instantly"

**New Process:**
1. Query: `WHERE CUSTOMER_ID = 'CUST_00234'`
2. Instant results:
   - **YTD Return:** 8.4% (industry average: 7.2% – outperforming!)
   - **Sharpe Ratio:** 1.23 (excellent risk-adjusted returns)
   - **Asset Allocation:** 65% equity, 25% fixed income, 8% cash, 2% commodities
   - **Volatility:** 11.2% (moderate risk, aligned with client profile)
   - **Commission Costs:** €1,240 YTD (1.2% of AUM – competitive)

**Advisor Response (in meeting, not 2 days later):**
"You're up 8.4% year-to-date, which outperforms the market by 1.2%. Your Sharpe ratio of 1.23 means you're getting excellent returns relative to the risk taken. Your portfolio volatility of 11% is perfectly aligned with your moderate risk tolerance. You're doing significantly better than industry average."

**Client:** "That's exactly what I wanted to hear. Actually, I have €300K from a property sale – can you invest it the same way?"

**Outcome:** Client delighted, additional €300K AUM captured, €2,250 annual fee revenue, advisor credibility strengthened

**Quantified Value:**
- **Time Saved:** 3 hours per client × 45 clients/quarter = 135 hours = **€27,000 annually**
- **AUM Retention:** 2 high-value clients retained/year = €4.8M AUM × 0.75% = **€36K annually**
- **New AUM Capture:** 4 add-on investments/year avg €250K = €1M × 0.75% = **€7.5K annually**
- **Referrals:** 6 new clients/year avg €400K AUM = €2.4M × 0.75% = **€18K annually**
- **Total Annual Value:** €88,500

- **Who:** Relationship manager pitching high-net-worth prospect
- **Prospect:** "Why should I move from my current advisor?"
- **Demo:** Show real-time portfolio performance dashboard on iPad during meeting

- **Client Response:** "You're the first advisor who's ever proactively found tax savings for me"
- **ROI:** Strengthened relationships, prevented 2 clients from leaving, referrals generated

**Use Case 3: Portfolio Rebalancing Automation**
- **Who:** Portfolio management team
- **Need:** Identify portfolios drifting from target allocations
- **Query:** `WHERE ABS(EQUITY_ALLOCATION_PERCENTAGE - 60) > 10` (target 60% equity, ±10% tolerance)
- **Result:** 23 portfolios require rebalancing
- **Action:** Generate rebalancing proposals automatically
- **Client Impact:** Portfolios maintained at target risk level, discipline enforced
- **ROI:** 23 clients × 2 hours saved = 46 hours = **€11,500 annually**

**Use Case 4: Performance Attribution Analysis**
- **Who:** Investment committee reviewing advisor performance
- **Need:** Which advisors are delivering best risk-adjusted returns?
- **Query:** `GROUP BY ADVISOR, CALCULATE AVG(SHARPE_RATIO)`
- **Result:** Advisor A: 1.42 Sharpe (top performer), Advisor B: 0.87 Sharpe (needs coaching)
- **Action:** Replicate Advisor A's strategy, train Advisor B
- **ROI:** Improved overall client outcomes, reduced attrition

---

### Report 1.2: Asset Allocation Intelligence

**Business Question:** _"Is this portfolio allocated optimally, and where are the opportunities?"_

#### Why It Exists
Asset allocation drives 90% of portfolio returns (Brinson study). But advisors spend 90% of time on security selection (drives 10% of returns). Result? Suboptimal portfolios, clients taking too much/little risk, missed rebalancing opportunities.

**This report changes the game:** Automated asset allocation monitoring, drift detection, rebalancing triggers, risk-alignment validation.

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Current Allocation:** Cash/Equity/Fixed Income/Commodity percentages
- **Target Allocation:** Client's investment policy statement (IPS) targets
- **Drift Analysis:** How far current allocation deviated from target
- **Rebalancing Recommendation:** Buy/sell suggestions to restore target
- **Risk Alignment:** Does allocation match client risk tolerance?

**Asset Allocation Framework:**

**Conservative (Age 60+, Low Risk Tolerance):**
- 10% Cash, 30% Equity, 55% Fixed Income, 5% Commodities
- Goal: Capital preservation, income generation
- Expected Return: 4-6%, Volatility: 6-8%

**Moderate (Age 40-60, Medium Risk Tolerance):**
- 5% Cash, 60% Equity, 30% Fixed Income, 5% Commodities
- Goal: Growth with stability
- Expected Return: 7-9%, Volatility: 10-12%

**Aggressive (Age <40, High Risk Tolerance):**
- 5% Cash, 80% Equity, 10% Fixed Income, 5% Commodities
- Goal: Maximum growth, accept volatility
- Expected Return: 10-12%, Volatility: 15-18%

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Quarterly portfolio review (Investment Advisory Team)

**Process:** Automated scan of all client portfolios for allocation drift >10%

**Query:** `WHERE ABS(EQUITY_ALLOCATION - TARGET_EQUITY_ALLOCATION) > 10`

**Results Found:**
1. **Client A (Age 65, Conservative):**
   - **Target:** 30% equity, 55% fixed income
   - **Actual:** 48% equity, 37% fixed income (equity market rally)
   - **Risk:** Taking 60% more equity risk than intended
   - **Action:** Sell €180K equity, buy €180K bonds, restore 30/55 allocation
   - **Client Impact:** Risk realigned, captured equity gains, protected capital
   
2. **Client B (Age 42, Moderate):**
   - **Target:** 60% equity, 30% fixed income
   - **Actual:** 52% equity, 38% fixed income (missed equity rally)
   - **Opportunity:** Underinvested in equities, missed 8% market gains
   - **Action:** Rebalance from bonds to equities, capture future growth
   - **Client Impact:** Positioned for growth, aligned with goals

3. **Client C (Age 35, Aggressive):**
   - **Target:** 80% equity, 10% fixed income
   - **Actual:** 45% cash (recent inheritance), 40% equity, 15% fixed income
   - **Problem:** €450K sitting in cash earning 0.5%, should be earning 10%+
   - **Action:** Invest €400K from cash → 70% equity, 20% fixed income, 10% cash
   - **Client Impact:** €400K × 9.5% extra return = **€38K annual income gain**

**Efficiency Gains:**
- **Before:** Manual review of 200 portfolios = 80 hours quarterly
- **After:** Automated drift detection, 23 portfolios flagged = 12 hours quarterly
- **Annual Savings:** 272 hours = **€68,000 in labor**

**Client Value:**
- **Risk Management:** 47 clients rebalanced to proper risk levels
- **Return Optimization:** Avg 1.2% annual return improvement across portfolio
- **Client Satisfaction:** Proactive management vs. reactive

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Life Event Triggered Reallocation**
- **Scenario:** Client turned 65, retiring next month
- **Current Allocation:** 75% equity (aggressive – worked during accumulation phase)
- **Retirement Need:** 40% equity (moderate – need stability for withdrawals)
- **Automated Alert:** "Client CUST_00456 age 65, allocation misaligned with life stage"
- **Action:** Proactive call: "Congratulations on retirement! Let's adjust your portfolio for income."
- **ROI:** Client protected from market downturn in first year of retirement, relationship strengthened

**Use Case 2: Market Volatility Response**
- **Scenario:** Market correction, equity markets down 15% in 2 weeks
- **Client Behavior:** Panic calls: "Should I sell everything?!"
- **Advisor Response:** "Let's look at your allocation. You're 58% equity (target 60%). You're exactly where you should be. In fact, this is a buying opportunity."
- **Data-Driven Confidence:** Show client they're not overleveraged, aligned with plan
- **Result:** Client stays invested, captures market recovery, avoids emotional decisions
- **ROI:** Prevented 8 clients from panic selling = **€1.2M AUM retained**

**Use Case 3: New Asset Class Introduction**
- **Who:** Investment committee deciding to add commodities (5% allocation)
- **Need:** Identify portfolios with room for commodities (currently 0% allocated)
- **Query:** `WHERE CMD_ALLOCATION_PERCENTAGE = 0 AND TOTAL_PORTFOLIO_VALUE > 500000`
- **Result:** 67 portfolios with >€500K could add commodities for diversification
- **Action:** "We've added gold/oil exposure for inflation protection. Would you like this in your portfolio?"
- **Response:** 41 clients opt in, avg €25K allocation
- **ROI:** €1.025M new AUM in commodities = **€7,675 annual fees**

## Part 2: Risk Management & Compliance

### The Business Challenge

**Compliance Officer problem:** Advisor placed 80-year-old widow in 90% equity portfolio. Client lost 40% in market correction, sues for suitability violation. €350K settlement. Regulatory fine: €150K. Reputation damage: priceless. Need proactive suitability monitoring, not reactive crisis management.

---

### Report 2.1: Risk Analytics & Suitability Monitoring
**Business Question:** _"Are client portfolios aligned with their risk tolerance and investment objectives?"_

#### Why It Exists
MiFID II requires suitability assessments. But assessments done at onboarding, portfolios drift over time. 75-year-old's "moderate risk" portfolio from age 60 now unsuitable. Advisor too busy to monitor. Compliance finds out during audit (too late).

**This report changes the game:** Continuous suitability monitoring, automated risk tolerance validation, proactive exception alerts.

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Portfolio Volatility:** Standard deviation of returns (risk measurement)
- **Maximum Drawdown:** Largest peak-to-trough decline (downside risk)
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Risk-adjusted returns (efficiency measurement)
- **Risk Tolerance Alignment:** Does actual risk match client risk profile?
- **Suitability Score:** Compliance rating (green/yellow/red)

**Risk Metrics Explained:**

**Volatility (Standard Deviation):**
- **Low Risk:** <8% volatility (conservative, capital preservation)
- **Moderate Risk:** 8-12% volatility (balanced, growth with stability)
- **High Risk:** >12% volatility (aggressive, maximum growth)

**Maximum Drawdown:**
- **What:** Largest decline from peak to trough
- **Why:** Shows worst-case scenario client experienced
- **Example:** Portfolio peaked at €1M, dropped to €800K, recovered to €950K → Max drawdown = 20%

**Sharpe Ratio (Risk-Adjusted Return):**
- **Formula:** (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility
- **Interpretation:** Higher is better (more return per unit of risk)
- **Benchmark:** Market Sharpe ≈ 0.8-1.0, Good advisor ≈ 1.2-1.5

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Monthly compliance review (Chief Compliance Officer)

**Query:** `WHERE PORTFOLIO_VOLATILITY > (CLIENT_RISK_TOLERANCE + 5%)`

**Results – Suitability Exceptions:**

1. **Client A (Age 72, Conservative Risk Tolerance):**
   - **Target Volatility:** 6% (conservative)
   - **Actual Volatility:** 16.8% (aggressive)
   - **Problem:** Client taking 2.8× intended risk
   - **Root Cause:** Equity allocation 78% (should be 30%)
   - **Action:** Immediate review, rebalance to conservative allocation
   - **Compliance Impact:** Suitability violation prevented before client loss

2. **Client B (Age 45, Moderate Risk Tolerance):**
   - **Target Volatility:** 10% (moderate)
   - **Actual Volatility:** 18.2% (high)
   - **Problem:** Concentrated equity position (42% in single tech stock)
   - **Risk:** Concentration + high volatility = inappropriate risk
   - **Action:** Diversification recommendation, reduce single position to <10%
   - **Client Response:** "I didn't realize I was so concentrated. Let's diversify."

3. **Client C (Age 68, Recently Widowed):**
   - **Original Profile:** Moderate risk (when spouse was alive, dual income)
   - **Current Situation:** Single income, relying on portfolio for living expenses
   - **Risk Tolerance Change:** Should be conservative (not updated in system)
   - **Action:** Schedule suitability review, update risk profile, reallocate
   - **Regulatory Compliance:** Proactive response to life change event

**Compliance Value:**
- **Before:** Suitability violations discovered during annual audit (after client loss)
- **After:** Continuous monitoring, proactive intervention (before client loss)
- **Prevented Losses:** 3 significant suitability issues/year × €200K avg = **€600K in potential losses**
- **Regulatory Risk Mitigation:** Zero suitability complaints, demonstrate ongoing monitoring

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Age-Based Risk Escalation**
- **Automated Alert:** All clients age 65+ automatically screened quarterly
- **Logic:** As clients age, risk tolerance should decrease (less time to recover from losses)
- **Query:** `WHERE CLIENT_AGE >= 65 AND EQUITY_ALLOCATION > 50%`
- **Result:** 12 recently-retired clients with >50% equity (potentially too aggressive)
- **Action:** Trigger suitability review conversations
- **ROI:** Proactive compliance, prevented 2 suitability complaints

**Use Case 2: Concentrated Position Risk**
- **Risk:** Client has 40% of portfolio in single stock (former employer)
- **Problem:** Portfolio volatility 22% (should be 10% for moderate risk profile)
- **Alert:** `WHERE MAX_SINGLE_POSITION_PCT > 20%`
- **Advisor:** "I noticed 40% of your portfolio is in XYZ Corp. If something happens to that company, you could lose 40% of your wealth. May I suggest diversification?"
- **Client:** "My financial advisor at my previous bank never mentioned this. Thank you for looking out for me."
- **ROI:** Retained client relationship, prevented concentration risk loss

**Use Case 3: Market Stress Testing**
- **Scenario:** Market volatility spike (VIX above 30)
- **Need:** Which clients might panic and call?
- **Query:** `WHERE PORTFOLIO_VOLATILITY > 15% AND CLIENT_RISK_TOLERANCE = 'CONSERVATIVE'`
- **Result:** 18 conservative clients with high-volatility portfolios
- **Proactive Action:** Call clients BEFORE they panic: "Markets are volatile. Your portfolio is performing as expected. Here's the plan."
- **ROI:** Prevented panic selling, maintained discipline, strengthened relationships

## Part 3: Revenue Optimization & Business Intelligence

### The Business Challenge

**Branch Manager problem:** 200 advisors, €2.4B AUM, but don't know which clients are profitable, which advisors are stars, where growth opportunities hide. Compensating advisors based on AUM alone (not profitability). High-touch service for low-value clients, neglecting high-value prospects.

---

### Report 3.1: Trading Activity & Commission Revenue
**Business Question:** _"Which clients generate revenue, and how can we optimize profitability?"_

#### Why It Exists
Bank earns fees from: AUM-based fees (0.5-1.5%), trading commissions (equity/bond trades), custody fees, financial planning. Some clients trade frequently (high commission revenue), others buy-and-hold (low revenue). Need to understand profitability to allocate resources properly.

**This report changes the game:** Revenue analytics by client, advisor, product, service model optimization.

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **AUM-Based Revenue:** Portfolio value × fee tier (0.5-1.5%)
- **Trading Commission Revenue:** Number of trades × average commission
- **Total Client Revenue:** AUM fees + commissions + other fees
- **Cost-to-Serve:** Advisor time × cost per hour
- **Client Profitability:** Revenue - cost-to-serve
- **Revenue Density:** Revenue per advisor relationship

**Fee Structure Examples:**

**Tier 1 (Retail): AUM <€100K:**
- AUM Fee: 1.5%
- Trading Commission: €9.95/trade
- Service: Online platform, email support

**Tier 2 (Mass Affluent): AUM €100K-500K:**
- AUM Fee: 1.0%
- Trading Commission: €4.95/trade
- Service: Quarterly reviews, phone advisor

**Tier 3 (High Net Worth): AUM €500K-2M:**
- AUM Fee: 0.75%
- Trading Commission: €2.95/trade
- Service: Dedicated advisor, monthly reviews

**Tier 4 (Ultra HNWI): AUM >€2M:**
- AUM Fee: 0.50%
- Trading Commission: Negotiated
- Service: Relationship manager, weekly reviews, custom solutions

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Annual advisor compensation review (Head of Wealth Management)

**Query:** Calculate revenue per advisor, client profitability distribution

**Analysis Results:**

**Advisor A: €12M AUM, 45 clients**
- **Average AUM per Client:** €267K
- **Annual Revenue:** €96,000 (€12M × 0.8% avg fee)
- **Trading Commissions:** €12,400 (240 trades)
- **Total Revenue:** €108,400
- **Cost-to-Serve:** €45,000 (salary allocation)
- **Profitability:** €63,400 (58% margin)
- **Assessment:** **Star performer** – profitable clients, efficient service model

**Advisor B: €8M AUM, 120 clients**
- **Average AUM per Client:** €67K
- **Annual Revenue:** €104,000 (€8M × 1.3% avg fee – higher % on smaller accounts)
- **Trading Commissions:** €3,200 (80 trades)
- **Total Revenue:** €107,200
- **Cost-to-Serve:** €78,000 (many small clients = high touch time)
- **Profitability:** €29,200 (27% margin)
- **Assessment:** **Inefficient** – similar revenue to Advisor A, but 50% lower profitability

**Business Decision:**
- **Advisor A:** Increase compensation, assign HNWI prospects
- **Advisor B:** Transition small clients to digital platform, focus on larger relationships
- **Branch Impact:** Optimize resource allocation, improve profitability

**ROI Analysis:**
- **Advisor B Optimization:** Reduce 120 clients to 60 (transition 60 to digital)
- **Cost-to-Serve Reduction:** €78K → €45K (33 hours/week saved)
- **New Client Capacity:** 20 HNWI clients (avg €400K AUM)
- **Additional Revenue:** €60K (€8M new AUM × 0.75%)
- **Profit Improvement:** €33K cost reduction + €60K revenue = **€93K annually**

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Client Segmentation Strategy**
- **Analysis:** Rank clients by profitability (revenue - cost-to-serve)
- **Top 20% Clients:** Generate 75% of profit
- **Bottom 20% Clients:** Generate 5% of profit (consume 30% of advisor time)
- **Strategy Shift:** 
  - Top 20%: White-glove service, relationship managers, custom solutions
  - Middle 60%: Standard service, quarterly reviews, advisor-led
  - Bottom 20%: Digital platform, robo-advisory, self-service
- **Result:** Resources aligned with profitability
- **ROI:** 15% improvement in branch profitability = **€180K annually**

**Use Case 2: Cross-Sell Opportunity Identification**
- **Query:** `WHERE AUM > 500000 AND TOTAL_TRADES < 5` (high AUM, low engagement)
- **Result:** 23 clients with €500K+ portfolios, minimal trading activity
- **Interpretation:** Buy-and-hold investors, may not be receiving active management
- **Opportunity:** "Mr. Client, I noticed you haven't rebalanced in 18 months. May I review your allocation?"
- **Cross-Sell:** Financial planning, tax loss harvesting, estate planning
- **ROI:** 8 clients upgrade to full advisory = €80K additional annual revenue

**Use Case 3: Advisor Coaching & Best Practices**
- **Analysis:** Compare top-quartile advisors vs. bottom-quartile on revenue per client
- **Top Quartile:** €3,200 revenue per client, 32 trades/client/year
- **Bottom Quartile:** €1,800 revenue per client, 8 trades/client/year
- **Gap Analysis:** Top advisors proactively suggest rebalancing, tax strategies
- **Training Program:** Teach bottom-quartile advisors proactive engagement techniques
- **Result:** Bottom quartile improves 25% in revenue per client
- **ROI:** €240K additional annual revenue across branch

## Part 4: Client Experience & Retention

### The Business Challenge

**Head of Private Banking problem:** Client attrition rate 8% annually. Exit interviews reveal: "Advisor never calls," "Performance unclear," "Competitor offers better service." Losing €48M AUM/year = €360K annual revenue. Need proactive engagement, not reactive crisis management.

---

### Report 4.1: Client Engagement & Retention Analytics
**Business Question:** _"Which clients are at risk of leaving, and how do we retain them?"_

#### Why It Exists
Clients leave when they feel neglected. Warning signs: No contact in 90+ days, declining AUM, increased withdrawals, no response to advisor outreach. By time client says "I'm leaving," too late to save relationship.

**This report changes the game:** Predictive churn analytics, proactive engagement triggers, retention workflow automation.

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Days Since Last Contact:** Advisor-client communication frequency
- **AUM Trend:** Growing, stable, or declining portfolio
- **Transaction Activity:** Deposits vs. withdrawals trend
- **Performance vs. Benchmark:** Client outperforming or underperforming?
- **Service Tier Alignment:** Receiving appropriate service level?
- **Churn Risk Score:** Predictive model (0-100%)

**Churn Risk Indicators:**

**High Risk (Score 70-100):**
- No advisor contact >120 days
- AUM declined >20% (excluding market effects)
- Net withdrawals >€50K in 90 days
- Underperforming benchmark by >5%
- Unanswered advisor calls/emails

**Medium Risk (Score 40-69):**
- No advisor contact 60-120 days
- AUM declined 10-20%
- Net withdrawals €10K-50K
- Performance lagging benchmark 2-5%
- Reduced engagement in reviews

**Low Risk (Score 0-39):**
- Regular advisor contact (<60 days)
- AUM stable or growing
- Net deposits or minimal withdrawals
- Meeting/exceeding benchmark
- Active participation in reviews

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Monday morning retention review (Relationship Management Team)

**Query:** `WHERE CHURN_RISK_SCORE > 70 ORDER BY AUM DESC`

**High-Risk Clients Identified:**

**Client A: €1.8M AUM, Churn Score 87**
- **Warning Signs:**
  - 147 days since last advisor contact
  - €240K withdrawn in last 60 days (13% of portfolio)
  - Portfolio underperforming benchmark by 6.2%
  - 2 unreturned advisor calls
- **Root Cause Investigation:**
  - Advisor on medical leave for 4 months, no coverage assigned
  - Market downturn in Q1, client worried, nobody available to discuss
  - Competitor reached out with "portfolio review" offer
- **Immediate Action:**
  - Branch manager personally calls client within 2 hours
  - Schedule face-to-face meeting tomorrow
  - Prepare portfolio analysis showing year-over-year performance (not just bad quarter)
  - Assign dedicated relationship manager immediately
- **Outcome:**
