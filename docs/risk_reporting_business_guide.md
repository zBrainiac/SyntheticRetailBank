## The Business Problem We Solved

### Before: Regulatory Reporting as a Cost Center

Imagine it's **Friday afternoon at 4 PM**. The **Chief Risk Officer** receives an urgent email from the ECB:

**"Submit your Basel III Risk Weighted Assets calculation by Monday 9 AM, including:**
1. **Credit risk exposure** across all portfolios
2. **Market risk capital** for trading book
3. **BCBS 239 compliance** metrics
4. **IRB model validation** results

**Traditional Process:**
- **Friday 4 PM:** Panic. Start calling IT, Finance, Trading Desk, Credit Risk teams
- **Friday 6 PM:** IT says they need to extract data from 15 systems
- **Saturday 9 AM:** 8 Excel files arrive via email, all with different formats
- **Saturday 2 PM:** Discover inconsistencies: Trading says €500M exposure, Finance says €480M
- **Sunday 10 AM:** Still reconciling. Formulas breaking. Manual calculations.
- **Monday 8 AM:** Submit incomplete report with disclaimers
- **Monday 10 AM:** Regulator calls: "Your numbers don't match your previous submission"

**Cost:** €15K in weekend labor, damaged regulator relationship, reputational risk, CEO demanding explanations

**The Real Problem:** Regulatory reporting seen as **compliance tax**, not **strategic asset**

---

### After: Risk Reporting as Strategic Intelligence

Same Friday afternoon, same ECB request:

**New Process:**
- **Friday 4:15 PM:** Open laptop, run 4 pre-built queries
- **Friday 4:25 PM:** Export to Excel template, add 2-paragraph narrative
- **Friday 4:35 PM:** Quality check: Cross-reference numbers automatically
- **Friday 4:40 PM:** Submit report to ECB portal
- **Friday 4:45 PM:** Forward copy to CEO with executive summary
- **Friday 5:00 PM:** Leave office. Weekend saved.

**Monday 9 AM:** ECB calls: "Your submission is exemplary. Can we use it as best practice example?"

**Value:** €15K labor saved, regulator delighted, CEO impressed, reputation enhanced, CRO enjoying weekend

**The Transformation:** From **compliance burden** to **competitive advantage**

## Part 1: Customer Analytics & AML Intelligence

### The Business Challenge

**Head of AML problem:** Team drowns in alerts. 100 suspicious activity flags daily. 60 are false positives. Real threats buried in noise. €450K annual cost investigating innocent customers.

---

### Report 1.1: REPP_AGG_DT_CUSTOMER_SUMMARY
**Business Question:** _"Which customers are high-risk, and why?"_

#### Why It Exists
Traditional banks treat all customers equally in monitoring systems. Result? Compliance team wastes 80% of time investigating low-risk customers with unusual (but legitimate) activity.

**This report changes the game:** Combines customer profile, transaction behavior, anomaly flags, and account diversity into a single risk score.

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Customer Risk Profile:** Onboarding date, anomaly flag, account count
- **Transaction Behavior:** Total volume, average size, maximum transaction, currency diversity
- **Anomaly Metrics:** Count of suspicious transactions, anomalous amount

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Monday morning AML review (Head of AML)

**Query:** Show me customers with `HAS_ANOMALY = TRUE` and `ANOMALOUS_TRANSACTIONS > 5`

**Result:** 8 customers identified for investigation (vs. 60 in old system)

**Investigation Efficiency:**
- **Before:** 60 alerts → 48 hours to clear → €1,200 labor cost
- **After:** 8 alerts → 6 hours to clear → €150 labor cost
- **Annual Savings:** €1,050 per day × 250 business days = **€262K saved**

**Business Outcome:** AML team focuses on real threats, not false positives

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: High-Value Customer Profiling**
- **Who:** Relationship management team
- **Need:** Identify customers with >€500K transaction volume for wealth management outreach
- **Result:** 12 customers identified, 8 converted to private banking, €8.2M new AUM
- **Revenue:** €164K annual fees (2% AUM)

**Use Case 2: Multi-Currency Risk**
- **Who:** Treasury team managing FX exposure
- **Need:** Identify customers with >5 currencies (concentration risk)
- **Result:** 3 customers flagged, all legitimate import/export businesses
- **Risk Management:** Proper classification prevents false sanctions screening

---

### Report 1.2: REPP_AGG_DT_ANOMALY_ANALYSIS
**Business Question:** _"What percentage of this customer's activity is suspicious?"_

#### Why It Exists
**The false positive problem:** AML system flags customer because ONE transaction looks odd. But what if that's 1 suspicious transaction out of 1,000 normal ones? That's 0.1% anomaly rate = probably legitimate.

**What if 80% of transactions are anomalous?** That's a real SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) candidate.

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Anomaly Percentage:** What % of customer's transactions are flagged
- **Anomaly Types:** What triggered the flags (high-amount, offshore, crypto, off-hours)
- **Total Anomalous Amount:** How much money involved in suspicious activity

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** SAR filing decision (Compliance officer)

**Customer A:**
- Total transactions: 1,000
- Anomalous transactions: 5
- Anomaly percentage: **0.5%**
- **Decision:** Clear flag, legitimate customer with occasional large transactions

**Customer B:**
- Total transactions: 50
- Anomalous transactions: 40
- Anomaly percentage: **80%**
- **Decision:** File SAR immediately, high likelihood of money laundering

**Business Outcome:** Prioritized SAR filing, regulator confidence, no wasted effort on false positives

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Anomaly Pattern Detection**
- **Who:** Fraud investigation team
- **Need:** Identify customers with sudden spike in anomaly percentage (behavior change)
- **Result:** 1 customer went from 2% anomaly rate to 85% in 2 weeks
- **Finding:** Account takeover fraud detected, €45K loss prevented

**Use Case 2: Anomaly Type Analysis**
- **Who:** AML policy team
- **Need:** Understand which anomaly types are most common (refine detection rules)
- **Result:** "OFF_HOURS" transactions are 70% false positives (shift workers)
- **Policy Change:** Adjusted detection rules, reduced false positives by 35%

---

### Report 1.3: REPP_AGG_DT_LIFECYCLE_ANOMALIES
**Business Question:** _"Did this customer suddenly become suspicious AFTER a major life event?"_

#### Why It Exists
**Classic money laundering pattern:**
1. Open account (looks normal)
2. Stay dormant for 6 months (establish legitimacy)
3. Suddenly reactivate with huge wire transfer (launder money)
4. Close account and disappear

**This report detects exactly that pattern.**

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Lifecycle Event:** REACTIVATION, ADDRESS_CHANGE, EMPLOYMENT_CHANGE
- **Dormancy Period:** How long was account inactive before event
- **Transaction Anomaly:** Suspicious transaction within 30 days of event
- **AML Risk Level:** CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- **SAR Filing Flag:** Automatic recommendation for Suspicious Activity Report

#### Real-World Use Case
**Scenario:** Dormant account reactivation (AML analyst)

**Customer CUST_00789:**
- **Jan 2024:** Opened account, deposited €5K
- **Jan-Aug 2024:** Zero activity (dormant 240 days)
- **Sep 1, 2024:** Account reactivated
- **Sep 2, 2024:** €250K wire transfer to offshore account (CRITICAL anomaly)
- **System Alert:** REQUIRES_SAR_FILING = TRUE

**Investigation (15 minutes):**
- Verify customer identity: Passport expired, contact info disconnected
- Check address history: Changed address day before reactivation
- Review transaction source: Unverified third-party sender

**Action:** File SAR, freeze account, notify authorities

**Business Outcome:** Money laundering attempt stopped, €250K recovered, bank avoided €1M+ penalty

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Address Change + Wire Transfer**
- **Who:** Fraud prevention team
- **Need:** Detect customers who change address then immediately send large wire
- **Result:** 2 cases flagged in Q4, both confirmed fraud (account takeover)
- **Fraud Prevented:** €135K total loss avoided

**Use Case 2: Employment Change + Credit Behavior**
- **Who:** Credit risk team
- **Need:** Monitor customers who lost job then suddenly make large cash deposits (income source?)
- **Result:** 3 customers flagged for income verification before extending credit
- **Risk Mitigation:** Prevented 1 potential default (€75K exposure)

---

## Part 2: Equity Trading Intelligence

### The Business Challenge

**Trading Desk problem:** €280K monthly commissions from 500 trades. But no visibility into which customers are profitable, which positions have concentration risk, or which trades need compliance review.

**Brokerage operations:** Regulator requires "best execution" proof. Manual process takes 4 hours per audit request.

---

### Report 2.1: REPP_AGG_DT_EQUITY_SUMMARY
**Business Question:** _"Which customers generate the most commission revenue?"_

#### Why It Exists
**The 80/20 rule:** 20% of customers generate 80% of trading revenue. But which 20%? Without this report, you're guessing.

**Results:**
- **Top customer:** CUST_00042 → 45 trades → €8,500 commissions
- **Second:** CUST_00089 → 38 trades → €7,200 commissions
- **Top 20 total:** €84,000 commissions (30% of quarterly revenue)

**Action Plan:**
- Assign dedicated relationship manager to top 10 customers
- Offer preferential commission rates to retain top 20 (still profitable)
- Invite to exclusive trading webinar (engagement strategy)

**Business Outcome:**
- 18 of 20 customers renewed for next year
- Average trading volume increased 15%
- **Incremental revenue:** €15K per quarter = €60K annually

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Dormant Trader Reactivation**
- **Who:** Retention team
- **Need:** Identify customers with no trades in last 90 days but previously active
- **Result:** 8 customers identified, 5 reactivated after outreach call

- **Need:** Identify high-volume traders (>€100K volume) with only trading account
- **Result:** 3 customers opened wealth management accounts
- **Revenue:** €480K new AUM, €9.6K annual fees

---

### Report 2.2: REPP_AGG_DT_EQUITY_POSITIONS
**Business Question:** _"Do we have concentration risk in any single security?"_

#### Why It Exists
**Concentration risk scenario:** 50 customers all bought the same small-cap stock. Stock crashes. All 50 customers blame you. Reputation damage. Lawsuits. Regulator inquiry.

**This report prevents that:** Shows which securities have high customer concentration.

#### What's Inside (Business View)
- **Position Summary:** Net position (long/short), total bought/sold
- **Customer Concentration:** How many customers hold this security

- If stock drops 10%: €120K potential customer losses
- Reputational risk: High (many customers affected)

**Action:**
- Send risk disclosure email to all 23 customers
- Offer portfolio diversification consultation
- Document proper risk disclosure for compliance

**Business Outcome:** Proactive risk management, customers informed, compliance satisfied

#### Additional Use Cases

**Use Case 1: Illiquid Position Warning**

- **Result:** 2 small-cap stocks flagged, 8 customers holding illiquid positions
- **Risk Management:** Customer notification, liquidity warning documented

---

### Report 2.3: REPP_AGG_DT_HIGH_VALUE_EQUITY_TRADES
**Business Question:** _"Are any trades large enough to trigger regulatory reporting?"_

#### Why It Exists
**Regulatory requirement:** Trades >€100K CHF require enhanced monitoring for market manipulation, front-running, or insider trading.

**Manual process (before):** Compliance officer reviews 500 trades daily, manually flags large ones
**Automated process (after):** System automatically identifies trades >€100K

#### What's Inside (Business View)

---

### Report 4.1: REPP_AGG_DT_FRTB_RISK_POSITIONS
**Business Question:** _"What's our total trading book exposure across all asset classes?"_

#### Why It Exists

---

### Report 4.2: REPP_AGG_DT_FRTB_CAPITAL_CHARGES
**Business Question:** _"How much capital do we need for our trading book?"_

#### Why It Exists
**FRTB regulation:** Banks must calculate capital charges for delta, vega, curvature, and NMRF (Non-Modellable Risk Factors) risk.

**Capital = Cost:** Every €1M of capital requirement = €80K annual cost (8% hurdle rate)

**This report calculates:** Exact capital needed = optimal capital efficiency
